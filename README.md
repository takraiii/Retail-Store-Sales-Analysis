💡 Key Insights
Top Segment: Men aged 40-49 drive the highest revenue ($246K) and AOV ($479).

Seasonal Peak: Spring leads with $376K revenue and 1,300 orders.

Discount Efficiency: The 13–24% discount cohort is the most effective for revenue lift.

🚀 Strategic Recommendations
5.1 Prioritize high-value segment: Men aged 40–49
Action: Launch targeted CRM (personalized offers, bundles, premium service) to increase purchase frequency and AOV.

5.2 Scale electronics assortment by season
Action: Allocate inventory & marketing to seasonal top SKUs (mobile, smartwatch, laptop); offer accessory bundles and pre-season promotions.

KPI: Category revenue by season, stockout rate, GM%.

5.3 Immediate CX & quality improvement (rating < 4.0)
Action: Conduct root-cause analysis (post-purchase survey, returns review), tighten QC for low-rating categories, and improve returns/complaint SLA.

KPI: Avg. item rating, CSAT/NPS, complaint resolution time, retention.

5.4 Optimize discounting (focus 13–24% cohort)
Action: Run A/B tests for cart recovery and cohort discounts; measure revenue vs. margin impact before scaling.
